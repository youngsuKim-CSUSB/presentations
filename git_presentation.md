git vs. github (gitlab, bitbucket)

What does git do?
- version control 

What do the git cloud services do?
- Dropbox, Google Drive, Shared Point: focused on document sharing
    - git: document sharing, version control, 
- Actions, CI/CD support
    - examples: webpage hosting, software developement

We will use github as our primary example
- The basic unit (project) for git is called a git repository
- (Dropbox) big directory and its sub-directories.

Good use as version control:
- We can go back to the previous versions easily and compare them against another
- Rollback 
- Collaboration (not real time)

Git is a powerful tool but people experience a high learning curve
- git is primarily a command line tool
- git requires learning concepts that is (very) new to many people, including myself
- linear learning git is often inefficient and goal-oriented staged learning is suggested
