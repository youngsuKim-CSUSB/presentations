git vs. github (gitlab, bitbucket)

What does git do?
- version control 
- collaboration

What do the git cloud services do?
- Dropbox, Google Drive, Shared Point: focused on document sharing
    - git: document sharing, version control, diff 
- Actions, CI/CD support
    - examples: webpage hosting, software developement

We will use github as our primary example
- The basic unit (project) for git is called a git repository
- (Dropbox) big directory and its sub-directories.

Good use as version control:
- We can go back to the previous versions easily and compare them against another
- Rollback 
- Collaboration (not real time)

Git is a powerful tool but people experience a high learning curve
- git is primarily a command line tool
- git requires learning concepts that is (very) new to many people, including myself
- linear learning git is often inefficient and goal-oriented staged learning is suggested

Real life examples:
- Webpage hosting - Jekyll on GitHub
- Collaboration with students 
- Binder 
- App developement 

GitHub
- command line (hard core, fun, but may not be a great way to start)
- webpage (uniform environment, support VS Code, easy to work with)
- desktop app (heard about good things)
- app (never used it before)

branch, commit, head, stage

Peripherals
- credential
- git.ignore

Example:
